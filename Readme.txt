This game was made last summer designed and developed from scratch with a graphic design student a 2D game as a project for my game 
design course at AUC using Unity(c_sharp). We presented Liceen at Animatex Egypt 2023 in the game design section.
Liceen was created through the summer course through:
A 2D game where the player needs to get rid of head lice using a comb, tweezers and other tools before time runs out 
Interactive Elements 
- Hair (hair at first is straight making it easier to comb and as the levels progress the more textured the hair gets making it harder to comb) 
- Comb (once the comb goes into the hair, it reveals lice and nits) - Tweezers (it’s the default tool to kill lice and nits, kills one bug at a time and increases the score slightly) 
- Lice 
- Nits (each nit contains 5 lice bugs inside, it needs to be pinched by tweezers 5 times quickly or else it hatches into 5 lice bugs and increases the overall number of lice) 
- Mother lice (lice bug which lays several eggs at random occasions during the game) 
- Hair straightener power up (increases score, kills several bugs at the same time but takes a few seconds) 
- Blowtorcch power up (really increases score, kills several bugs at the same time, but if not careful can burn hair off) 
- Time constraint (time can be increased depending on the score ex. Each 500 points earned time is increased by 30 sec.) 
- Number of lice (it’s presented to inform how many bugs are left and adds up if a nit hatches, there is a limited # of lice until the player loses) 
- Score 
Game Loop 
- Comb 
- Get rid of lice and nits (tweezers, straightener or blowtorch) 
- Remove comb 
Win Condition 
Kill all lice before time runs out
Lose Condition 
- Reaching the limited # of lice (not getting rid of nits 
- Running out of time 
- Burning off the hair 
When the player loses, there’s a short animation of the person infected with lice either fainting from losing too much blood (because of lice feeding on their blood) or they enter a frenzie of uncontrollable itching. 
Emotional Experince 
- Absurd 
- Comedic 
- Stressful
